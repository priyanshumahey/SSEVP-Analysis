# SSEVP-Analysis
## The objective
The objective is to conduct research on the dataset provided by reading through the research paper it came from and then conducting further research about how this type of research is conducted. The dataset itself is taken from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Steady-State+Visual+Evoked+Potential+Signals. The dataset is also added onto this github repo. Once you get a deeper understanding of the dataset, you'll need to do an analysis and data cleaning. After that, you'll be writing up an analysis of what you found from processing the data. It is important to understand the pipeline. Create a detailed pipeline of the steps you're taking and create the final version in such a manner where additional data can be added and processed.


## Goals
The goals of this will be to:

1. Understand the data
2. Clear the data and conduct signal processing 
3. Conduct some signal analysis and understand what's going on in the signal  
4. Go through and do a write up on the data and do some research on what the signal means
5. Make the entire process into a detailed pipeline that can be easily implemented for new data
6. Create a presentation to share to the rest of the team
 

## Guide
Here's a small guide to help you guys get a headstart! To be successful, here is what I would start off with doing:

- Establish a project plan
- Learn about each others strengths
- Have timelines for when to finish tasks by
- Make use of the discord for communication and the github for code management
